## 🔄 Making Updates

### Update Frontend

```bash
cd c:\Users\panchu\Desktop\fhemarket
# Make your changes to frontend code
git add .
git commit -m "Update frontend"
git push
```

**Vercel automatically redeploys!** (takes ~2 minutes)

### Update Worker

```bash
cd c:\Users\panchu\Desktop\fhemarket
# Make your changes to worker code
git add .
git commit -m "Update worker"
git push
```

**Render automatically redeploys!** (takes ~3 minutes)

### Update Smart Contract

⚠️ **Cannot update deployed contract!** You would need to:
1. Deploy a new contract
2. Update contract address in frontend and worker
3. Redeploy frontend and worker

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Frontend Issues

**Problem**: Can't connect wallet
- **Solution**: Make sure you're on Sepolia network

**Problem**: Transaction fails
- **Solution**: Get more Sepolia ETH from faucet

**Problem**: Jobs not showing
- **Solution**: Refresh page, check you're connected

### Worker Issues

**Problem**: Worker not claiming jobs
- **Solution**: Check worker is registered, has ETH, and Render service is running

**Problem**: Worker crashed
- **Solution**: Check Render logs, restart service if needed

**Problem**: Out of gas
- **Solution**: Fund worker wallet with more Sepolia ETH

### Smart Contract Issues

**Problem**: Transaction reverted
- **Solution**: Check error message, ensure you meet requirements (stake, reward, etc.)
