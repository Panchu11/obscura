## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: Is my data really private?**
A: Yes! Your data is encrypted client-side before being sent. Workers compute on encrypted data and never see the plaintext.

**Q: How long does a job take?**
A: Typically 30-60 seconds from creation to completion.

**Q: What happens if no worker claims my job?**
A: You can cancel the job and get a refund, or wait for a worker to become available.

**Q: Can I see other people's jobs?**
A: Workers can see available (pending) jobs, but cannot see the encrypted data or results.

### Client Questions

**Q: How much should I set as reward?**
A: Minimum 0.001 ETH is recommended. Higher rewards may attract workers faster.

**Q: Can I cancel a job after it's claimed?**
A: No, you can only cancel pending jobs. Once claimed, you must wait for completion.

**Q: What if the result is wrong?**
A: Currently, you should verify the result before paying. Future versions will include dispute resolution.

**Q: Do I need to pay gas fees?**
A: Yes, you pay gas fees for creating jobs and verifying results.

### Worker Questions

**Q: How much can I earn?**
A: You earn the reward amount set by the client for each job you complete.

**Q: Why do I need to stake ETH?**
A: Staking ensures workers are committed and discourages malicious behavior.

**Q: Can I run multiple workers?**
A: Yes! You can run multiple worker nodes with different wallets.

**Q: What if my worker node crashes?**
A: Restart it. Uncompleted jobs will be available for other workers to claim.

## Best Practices

### For Clients

‚úÖ **Set appropriate rewards**: Higher rewards attract workers faster
‚úÖ **Verify results promptly**: Don't leave workers waiting
‚úÖ **Keep your private key safe**: You need it to decrypt results
‚úÖ **Monitor job status**: Check the Client tab regularly
‚úÖ **Cancel unused jobs**: Free up your funds if you no longer need the job

‚ùå **Don't set rewards too low**: Workers may ignore your jobs
‚ùå **Don't share your private key**: You'll lose access to results
‚ùå **Don't create duplicate jobs**: Wastes gas fees

### For Workers

‚úÖ **Keep your node running**: More uptime = more jobs
‚úÖ **Fund your wallet**: Ensure you have ETH for gas fees
‚úÖ **Monitor logs**: Check for errors regularly
‚úÖ **Build reputation**: Complete jobs to increase your score
‚úÖ **Stake more**: Higher stake = higher trust

‚ùå **Don't stop mid-job**: Damages your reputation
‚ùå **Don't run out of ETH**: You won't be able to submit results
‚ùå **Don't share your private key**: Protects your stake and earnings

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**Problem: Can't connect wallet**
- Solution: Refresh page, try different wallet, check browser extensions

**Problem: Wrong network**
- Solution: Switch to Sepolia in MetaMask

**Problem: Transaction fails**

**Problem: Can't verify result**
- Solution: Ensure job status is "Completed", check you have ETH for gas

### Worker Issues

**Problem: Worker not claiming jobs**
- Solution: Check worker is registered, has ETH, and node is running

**Problem: Worker node crashes**
- Solution: Check logs, ensure environment variables are correct, restart node

**Problem: Low reputation**
- Solution: Complete more jobs successfully, avoid abandoning jobs
